  <h2><a name="1"></a>1. Errors</h2>

  <h3><a name="Q1_1"></a>Q1.1: Why do I always get an
  <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no pkcs11wrapper in java.library.path</code>?</h3>
    <p>It seems that you do not have the pkcs11wrapper.dll (or libpkcs11wrapper.so
    under Unix) in your search path.
    You can provide such a path directly to the Java VM setting the <code>java.library.path</code>
    system property like:
    <p><code>
    java -Djava.library.path==../bin/&ltwindows|unix&gt/&ltplatform&gt/release;.
    -cp classes;../bin/iaikPkcs11Wrapper.jar
    demo.pkcs.pkcs11.GetInfo cryptoki.dll</code><p>
    
    where <code>../bin/&ltwindows|unix&gt/&ltplatform&gt/release</code> is the path where the
    pkcs11wrapper.dll (or libpkcs11wrapper.so under unix) file is. You can also place the file
    in the folder for binary files of your Java Runtime Environment; e.g. the <code>jre/bin</code> folder.
    Alternatively, you can also place the file pkcs11wrapper.dll in the system directory of Windows.
    On Unix systems you can place the libpkcs11wrapper.so in a <code>lib</code> directory of the system.
    </p>

  <h3><a name="Q1_2"></a>Q1.2: What does the exception with the error code
      <code>CKR_OPERATION_NOT_INITIALIZED</code> mean?</h3>
    <p>This normally means that the PKCS#11 driver you are using has a bug. We observed
      this bug with the drivers for iButton (version 1.01) and with older drviers
      for Datakey cards and iKey 2000 series tokens. For Datakey cards and iKey 2000
      series tokens there are already drivers that fix this bug.<br>
      Bug details: The wrapper asks the driver for the required buffer length for
      returned data. It uses the method specified in the PKCS#11 standard - it passes
      NULL_PTR as buffer when calling the driver function (e.g. C_Sign). The driver
      must answer with the required buffer length, but it must not abort any active
      operation (e.g. signing). Thereafter, the wrapper allocates the required buffer
      and calls the function (e.g. C_Sign) a second time, providing the appropriate
      buffer. Now the driver should process the operation and finalize it if appropriate.
      Drivers with that bug abort the active operation after the first (query buffer
      length) call. According to the standard they must not do this.<br>
      If you want to do a workaround, this is possible. You have to modify the function
      <code>Java_iaik_pkcs_pkcs11_wrapper_PKCS11Implementation_C_1Sign</code> in the file
      <code>pkcs11wrapper.c</code>. Instead of asking for the required buffer length,
      modify the wrapper to use a buffer with a sufficient length. Have a look the
      source code, you will quickly see what has to be done. To anticipate the question:
      No, this workaround will not become part of the next release. We do not include
      any code which's only purpose is to workaround bugs of third-party products.
      Ask the vendor of the product to fix the bug.</p>

  <h3><a name="Q1_3"></a>Q1.3: When running some of the samples which try to generate keys, I get an
    iaik.pkcs.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11Exception: CKR_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_INVALID. What is wrong?</h3>
    <p>We had similar problems with certain cards; e.g. the Rainbow iKey2032 and DataKey cards.
    This is due to bugs in drivers. As workaround you can try to set the class and key-type
    attributes as not present. This may look like this:
    <code><p>
    secretEnrcyptionKeyTemplate.getObjectClass().setPresent(false);<br>
    secretEnrcyptionKeyTemplate.getKeyType().setPresent(false);
    </code><p>
    maybe the driver accepts the key template if you try this.</p>

  <h3><a name="Q1_4">Q1.4</a>: I use the PKCS#11 Wrapper from within an applet. The applet works in principle,
    but when a press the reload button in my browser, I get an
    <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library pkcs11wrapper.dll already loaded in another classloader</code>. 
    What causes this problem and how can i solve it?</h3>
    <p>The Java VM causes this error. SUN's Java VMs have the restriction that they cannot handle native libraries
    from more than one classloader. You may have a look at the bug database at SUN's Java web site and search for
    the bug entries with the IDs 4286309, 4642062 and 4299094. According to the comments from SUN, according to
    the fact that they consider this a restriction (or a feature) rather than a bug, and that this bug has been
    there for many years, it is unlikely that this will be fixed soon. The only workaround that we are aware of is
    to place the class which directly accesses the native library 
    (i.e. <code>iaik.pkcs.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11Implementation</code>) or the complete jar file
    which contains this class (i.e. <code>iaikPkcs11Wrapper.jar</code>) into the 
    <code>jre/lib/ext</code> directory of the Java Runtime.
    Note that this problem may also occur in application servers. The solution will be analogous there. 
    <br>However, we have heard that there are other VMs (like Oracle) which do not contain this bug.

    <p>No, this is not a bug of the wrapper. It is a bug of the PKCS#11 driver that
      you use. We found such bugs in drivers for DataKey cards and iKey 2000 series
      tokens. </p>

  <h3><a name="Q2_2"></a>Q2.2: My application uses <code>findObjectsInit</code>,
    <code>findObjects</code> and <code>findObjectsFinal</code> to search for certain

  <h3><a name="Q3_1"></a>Q3.1: How can I import my private key and certificate into the smart card?</h3>
    <p>There is a demo included to do that. It is called <code>UploadPrivateKey</code>.</p>

  <h3><a name="Q3_2"></a>Q3.2: How can I export certificates from my smart card?</h3>
    <p>Extract the DER encoding (value attribute) of the certificate with</p>
    	<p><code>certificate.getValue().getByteArrayValue();</code></p>
    	<p>and write this bytes to a file like this:</p>
    	<p><code>FileOutputStream certificateDumpStream = new FileOutputStream(certificateDumpFilename);<br>
        certificateDumpStream.write(value);<br>
        certificateDumpStream.flush();<br>
        certificateDumpStream.close();</code></p>
